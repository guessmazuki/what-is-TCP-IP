# what-is-TCP-IP 
 => Tcp standard for "Trnasmission control protocol" a communication standard that enables application programs and computing device to exchange message 
 over network.
 
 => its is designed to send packet across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and message over network.
 
 => its one of the most commonly used protocols with in digital network communicatoin and ensures end-to-end data delivery.
 
 => It guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over a network.

 
 => TCP organization data so that it can be trnasmited beetwen a server and client.
 
 => Before it transmission data TCP estabilshes a conection beetwen a source and its destination which it ensures remains live until commonication begins.
 
 =>An alternative to TCP is the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is used to establish low-latency connections between applications and decrease           transmissions time.
  
  => TCP can be an expensive network tool as it includes absent or corrupted packets and protects data delivery with controls like          acknowledgments, connection startup, and flow control. 

   => UDP does not provide error connection or packet sequencing nor does it signal a destination before it delivers data, which makes it less reliable       but less expensive. As such, it is a good option for time-sensitive situations, such as Domain Name System (DNS) lookup, Voice over Internet Protocol          (VoIP), and streaming media.
 
 
#  what is ip?

=> The internet protocol"IP" is the method for sending data from one device to another across the internet.

=> Every device has an ip address that uniquely idetifies it and enable it to communication with and exachange data with other device connected to internet.

=> IP is responsible for definning how application and device exachange packet of data with each other.

=> It is the principal communication protocol responsible for the formats and rules for exachnging data and message beetwen computer on a single netework
 or several internet connected netework

=> IP is the main protocol within the internet layer of the TCP/IP. Its main purpose is to deliver data packets between the source application or device and the destination using methods and structures that place tags, such as address information, within data packets.
